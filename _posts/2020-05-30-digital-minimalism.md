Here is my take-away from reading [Digital Minimalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism){:target="_blank"} by Cal Newport. I would also recommend the episode [One: Wonderland](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/podcasts/rabbit-hole-internet-youtube-virus.html){:target="_blank"} from the Rabbit Hole podcast as a motivation for this content.

Digital minimalism is a method and ideology to minimize the negative side-effects of digital technology while maximizing the value it provides. It also incorporates ideas about how to best spend the leisure time freed up by the absence of low-value technology use.

The underlying issue this ideology addresses is the fact that companies use _your_ attention to make a profit, and do everything they can to acquire it. This is known as the "Attention Economy", where your attention is sold to a third party (advertisers). The ubiqitiousness of smartphones makes this easier than ever, with the addition of several advanced techniques from psychology and data science. At the time of writing, perpetrators include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and more.

There are also personal benefits to digital minimalism:
1. More free time
2. Free time becomes more satisfying and mentally relaxing
3. Better focus
4. Less anxiety

The best way to start practicing digital minimalism is to do a two-week detox of all but the most necessary applications and games. After this you can slowly reintroduce the technology that you carefully consider to provide real value to your life.

Here are some tips to help with the detox, and beyond:
1. Uninstall all social media and other non-essential applications from your phone that you often use.
2. Install a phone activity tracker, such as YourHour, to monitor how long you spend on your phone.
3. Get a watch with minimal functionality to use as a clock and alarm.
4. Install a website blocking tool in your laptop and desktop browser, such as LeechBlock NG. With these tools you can set a time limit per day, or a specific timeframe to allow activity.
5. To avoid interruptions, give people a consistent time to contact you (e.g. everyday at 6:00pm).
6. Try occupying your new leisure time with something hands-on (e.g. woodworking, hobby electronics, fixing your car).
7. Place a much higher value on face-to-face interactions instead of digital communication. We evolved to do this.

Here are some traits of technology use that provide value:
1. It aligns with your long-term goals, such as a relationship, a promotion, or buying a house.
2. It is used for _effective_ communication, such as scheduling to meet with a friend. This specifically excludes comments and likes on social media.
3. It enhances your leisure time, such as watching a YouTube video to learn how to do something specific you're working on. This specifically excludes browsing mindlessly.

Lastly, it's important to note that like regular minimalism, digital minimalism is not one-size-fits-all and you should adapt it to make the most of life.
